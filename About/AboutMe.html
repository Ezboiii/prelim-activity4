          <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Mateo Naz Jr., and I'm an aspiring frontend developer with a strong desire to learn and grow in this field. I have no background or clue about web development until i enrolled in this course, and I have always been fascinated by the power of design and technology to improve people's lives.

            I have been teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have completed several online courses and projects to further my skills. I am now eager to take my knowledge to the next level and work and adapt with the latest technologies being use to develop website and to build and launch real-world projects.
            
            In my free time, I enjoy experimenting and exploring new skills i learn from watching web development courses and I strive to apply these principles in all of my work.</p>
